## What is Kiai Time?
Ever have that one part of a song that's really good? Want to enhance that part of the song in your map? Chroma/NE too complex to work with or just plain unnecessary? **That's where this mod comes in!**

Engagieren, German for engage or "to be committed", enables mappers to activate and deactivate a "Kiai Time" mode during the song, where sabers (that use Engagieren) dynamically change their look, and everything starts to flash to the beat!

# Todo:
- [ ] Add chartable Kiai trigger that can be activated in beatmaps.
- [ ] Add animation controller integration for Custom Models.
- [ ] Port to Quest.
- [ ] Add BPM synced animation support and effects.
- [ ] Add firework spray on the sides of the runway that activate for a brief time when Kiai is activated.
